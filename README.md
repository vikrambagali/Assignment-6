# Weather Application

## Objective

This project focuses on building a weather application that utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API. The application will present weather data in a visually appealing CSS card format, showcasing detailed information such as current temperature, humidity levels, wind speed, and weather icons. Users can refresh the weather information through a dedicated button, ensuring the display remains accurate and up-to-date.

## Project Requirements

- Weather Data Display: 
  - Display key weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and relevant weather icons.

- Responsive Design: 
  - Ensure the weather application is responsive and functions seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.

- Refresh Button: 
  - Implement a refresh button that allows users to fetch the latest weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

- Visual Appeal: 
  - Utilize CSS cards to display the weather information in an organized and visually appealing manner.

- Separate Files and Clean Code: 
  - Organize the project such that each component has its own separate file for better readability and maintainability.

- Semantic Tags: 
  - Use semantic HTML tags to enhance accessibility and SEO.

- CSS Units: 
  - Avoid using pixel units; employ em, rem, or viewport units for all CSS styles.

## Technology Stack

- HTML5: For structuring the application and utilizing semantic tags.
- CSS3: For styling the application and creating responsive layouts using cards.
- JavaScript: To handle API requests, dynamically update the UI based on user interactions, and manage application logic.
- OpenWeatherMap API: For fetching real-time weather data.
